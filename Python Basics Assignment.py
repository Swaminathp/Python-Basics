# # Python Basics Assignment

# Q1. Using Python script as a calculator
# Create the variables n, r, p and assign them values 10, 5, and 100 respectively. Then
# evaluate the following expression in the Python console.
# ùê¥ = ùëù (1 + ùëü/ 100)n
# a. 100
# b. 162.89
# c. 189
# d. None of the above

# In[1]:


# Given values
n = 10
r = 5
p = 100

# Calculate A
A = p * (1 + r / 100) ** n

# Print the result
print(A)


# Answer : The computed value of 
# ùê¥
# A is 162.89 (rounded to two decimal places).
# Thus, the correct answer is:
# (b) 162.89 

# Q2. In a given string format operation, how will you print the given string.
# A = 10
# B = 20
# Str = "There are {} students in the class, with {} who play at least one sport."
# a. print(string.format(a,b))
# b. print(string+a+b)
# c. print(string.format(b,a))
# d. None of the above
# 

# In[2]:


A = 10
B = 20
Str = "There are {} students in the class, with {} who play at least one sport."

print(Str.format(B, A))


# Answer : c. print(string.format(b,a))

# Q3. In a given sample string, How do you print a double quoted string in between a
# regular
# string using the escape character?
# Sample output = It goes without saying, ‚ÄúTime is Money‚Äù, and none can deny it.
# a. print(‚ÄúIt goes without saying, \‚ÄúTime is Money\‚Äù, and none can deny it.‚Äù)
# b. print(‚ÄúIt goes without saying, \Time is Money\, and none can deny it.‚Äù)
# c. print(‚ÄúIt goes without saying‚Äù + ‚ÄúTime is Money‚Äù + ‚Äúand none can deny it.‚Äù)

# c. 30
# d. 1000
# 

# In[4]:


x = lambda a,b: a//b
x(10,3)


# Answer : b.3

# Q5. What will be the output of the following code?
# A = 10
# B = 12
# print("Smaller") if A == B else print("Greater") if A < B else print("True")
# a. True
# b. Smaller
# c. Greater
# d. None of the above

# In[5]:


A = 10
B = 12
print("Smaller") if A == B else print("Greater") if A < B else print("True")


# Answer : c. Greater

# print(arr1)
# 
# a. [2 7 3 5 4 6]
# b. TypeError
# c. NameError: name 'numpy' is not defined
# d. None of the above
# 

# In[6]:


import os
